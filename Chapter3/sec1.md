#  Scope of variables
1. Local variables (also known as method-local variables).
2. Method parameters (also known as method arguments).
3. Instance variables (also known as attributes, fields, and nonstatic variables).
4. Class variables (also known as static variables).

## Local variables
 **Defined within a method.**
 **To store the intermediate results of a calculation.**
- The scope of a local variable depends on the location of its declaration within a method.
- defined within a loop, if-else, or switch construct or within a code block (marked with {}) is limited to these constructs.
- defined outside any of these constructs are accessible across the complete method.
##  Method parameters
The variables that accept values in a method signature

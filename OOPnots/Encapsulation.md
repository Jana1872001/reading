# Encapsulation in java 

IS A Bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, which is called a class in Java.

Encapsulation is data hiding(information hiding).

Encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon the data.

Encapsulated classes are Java classes that follow data hiding.

Encapsulation is a procedure that takes place at the implementation level.

In Java, encapsulation is achieved by declaring the instance variables of a class as private.

To allow outside access to the instance variables, public methods called getters and setters are defined.

# Inheritance in Java

- **Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class.**

## Why need it ?
1. Code Reusability: code written in Superclass is common to all subclasses, **Child can directly use the parent code**.
2. Method Overriding: achievable only through Inheritance, **one of the ways by which Java achieves Run Time Polymorphism**.
3. Abstraction: concept of abstract is achieved through inheritance.

## Important Terminologies Used in Java Inheritance
1. Class.
2. SuperClass/ParentClass.
3. SubClass/ChildClass.
4. Reusability: reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.

> we use **extends** when we use inher , sub extends super

## Java Inheritance Types
1. Single Inheritance: subclasses inherit the features of one superclass.
2. Multilevel Inheritance: derived class will be inheriting a super class, and as well as the derived class also acts as the super class for other classes.
3. Hierarchical Inheritance: one class serves as a superclass for more than one subclass.
4. Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces): one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes , but java dose not support it , **we can achieve multiple inheritances only through Interfaces**.
5. Hybrid Inheritance:

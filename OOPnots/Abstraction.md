# Abstraction
### Data Abstraction is only the essential details are displayed to the user.
### process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details.

- Abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes.
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated, meaning we cannot create objects of it, but we can use it as a template for creating other classes that extend it.
- Abstract methods they have no implementation. The implementation is left for the concrete subclasses to define.
- Abstract classes and methods **enable polymorphism**in Java. **Polymorphism** is the ability of an object to take on many forms. This means that a variable of an abstract type can hold objects of any concrete subclass of that abstract class.
